### Price Tracking

## Limitations & Privacy
- **No background scraping:** Chrome extensions cannot scrape prices in the background without opening tabs (due to browser security and CORS).
- **No server-side tracking:** All data stays on your device. No external servers, no tracking.
- **Works best on standard e-commerce sites:** Some custom or highly dynamic sites may not be fully supported for auto-extraction.
